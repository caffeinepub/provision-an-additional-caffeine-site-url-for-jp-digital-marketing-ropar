  "summary": "REQ-11 is partially implemented: the default custom domain constant is updated to jpdigitalmarketing.in and the UI pre-fill logic appears to set this default when the backend returns no configured domain. However, based on the provided (truncated) diff summary, it is not clearly evidenced that all user-facing example text was updated from .net to .in, nor that the Delete/Reset site configuration action resets the custom-domain input back to the default.",

      "requirement": "All user-facing example text in the provisioning/publishing UI that previously referenced \"jpdigitalmarketing.net\" now references \"jpdigitalmarketing.in\" (including alerts and descriptions).",
      "reason": "The diff excerpt only shows the default constant and pre-fill logic; it does not show any user-facing example/description/alert text updates from .net to .in. Because the file content is truncated, this cannot be confirmed from the provided evidence.",

      "requirement": "After using the \"Delete/Reset site configuration\" action, the UI resets the custom domain input back to the default \"jpdigitalmarketing.in\" and reflects the unconfigured/offline state.",
      "reason": "The excerpt shows state reset for subdomain in `handleReset`, and shows a `useResetSiteStorage` hook is present, but it does not show that the reset/delete action explicitly resets `customDomain` back to DEFAULT_CUSTOM_DOMAIN (or clears configuredDomain and causes the default to be re-applied) and updates the UI to the unconfigured/offline state. Truncation prevents verification.",
